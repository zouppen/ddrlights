# DDR lights

This is a project in progress to allow controlling of lights via
Android. This gives the opportunity to use all networking and sensor
capabilities already on Android and use Arduino for doing the actual
low-level control.

This project is based on the ideas presented in
[AllAboutEE article]. There is also YouTube video about an
[early version] of this project in action.

# Androidâ€“Arduino protocol

The protocol between Android and Arduino has two candidates. Both are
described in [protocol specs]. One of these will be selected as the
"accepted" later on.
